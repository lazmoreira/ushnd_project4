# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

_For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:_

- _Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow_
- _Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app_
- _Justify your choice_

For this project I have chosen the App Service as it cheaper than th VM, the continuous deployment would speed up the development,
the high availability without any needed maintanance is a good fit for this project as well and as the project does not have any particularity
that would request a VM, the App service is the best solution.

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

_Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section._
If the team decided to rebuild the CMS app using a language as Go for example, which is not supported by App service yet
or if there's any other custom software needed or any specific OS setup needed.
